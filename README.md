# multithreaded server 

This project is about a multithreaded key-value pair storage server, with approximation client-server. Many clients send requests to the server, which should
serve them at the same time and send them the result of the request. Clients receive the result and print it. They are also being held information about all completed requests, as well as their total time service and waiting.

More information about the implementation of this project is provided in the file "README.pdf" (greek language)
